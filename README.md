# Mesh_Network_Simulation<br/><br/>

This is a simulation of a mesh network (mobile ad-hoc network) that I wrote in JavaScript and HTML5.

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), also known as wireless ad hoc network or ad hoc wireless network, is a continuously self-configuring, infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected wirelessly. This is a simulation of a mobile ad hoc network with some stationary nodes.
